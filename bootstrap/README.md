## Face detection

The number of faces, or their positions, are important features. Whether itâ€™s full face or profil, it can also have an impact. <br>
Using an unsupervised framework requires being confident in your algorithm, since one can not automati- cally test the final performance.<br>
Write a program that displays detected faces in a poster.

Library : OpenCV

## Colorimetry

Among other features that can be extracted from a poster, colorimetry may be rich in information. But colorimetry does not restrict to mean color only. <br>
It encompasses color emotion, color harmony, color variance. . .

Library : OpenCV

## OCR and text analysis

Text-based features are probably the most important ones. <br>
It includes font, text size, name of the movie maker or of actors and actresses, composition, text, color,...  <br>
Extracting these features requires two steps : 
1. OCR,which is getting the text from the poster 
2. text analysis.

OCR is a complex data, and you are not expected to develop your own algorithm.

Library : OpenCV and pyTessaract for instance
